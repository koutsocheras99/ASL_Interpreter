### ***This project is a basic American Sign Language interpreter which applies in a few letters(A,B,C,D,F,G,H,L).***

<br>

The DataSet was created by me and it consists of 4800 images.
  
  - 600 for each letter tottaly.
    - 500 for training
    - 50 for testing
    - 50 for validating
    
Every image has been going through blurring (Median and Gaussian) and thresholing with [Otsu's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method).
